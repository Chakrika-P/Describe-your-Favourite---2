            <p> Peacock is the national bird of India. They are large, colorful pheasants (typically blue and green) known for their iridescent tails. These tail feathers, or coverts, spread out in a distinctive train that is more than 60 percent of the bird's total body length and boast colorful "eye" markings of blue, gold, red, and other hues. Sometimes peacocks do escape. Which was remarkable, Webster said, because, in general, peacocks are not very smart.Peacocks can (sort of) fly they tend to run and take several small leaps before a big final hop. They can't stay airborne for very long, but their huge wingspan allows them to flutter quite far.

                 Male peacocks display their flashy trains and beautiful blue-green plumage to attract the peahens. They perform a peculiar dance to fascinate the females. You can find them prancing around the peahens to attract them. Trade of naturally shed peacock feathers is allowed under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, which although prohibits killing of the bird. The loophole in the law has been misused and had lead to rampant killing of the bird across India for highly lucrative feather business.
